    "text": "The interactive prisoner art explorer allows you to inspect details in Ervin Abadi‘s painting Bergen-Belsen View from Afar. You can choose between two modes. The compositional mode enables you to examine the different layers and helps to understand the spatial composition of the painting and the visual elements it contains. In the explorative mode you can touch certain elements of the painting and retrieve related information. Particular figures and objects refer to aspects of everyday life in Bergen-Belsen that shaped the situation and fate of the prisoners. Please note that not all elements are interactive. In addition, short digital videos explain other aspects of life and suffering in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in relation to prisoner art. Short digital videos provide a compelling way to communicate history by transforming sources like paintings, diaries, and letters into accessible, engaging content. This approach not only deepens engagement with the past but also ensures that complex narratives are presented in ways that resonate with today’s digitally-driven world, particularly for younger, digital-native generations.",

      "text": "Initially, not all prisoners were sent to working battalions. Only inmates from the Prisoners and Star camps were forced to maintain and expand other camps, while prisoners from the Residence, Neutral and Hungarian camps were spared. Yet with the front situation deteriorating in 1944, this hierarchy faded, as more people were involved in hard labor. By the end of the war, mostly women camps were subjected to the armament production. People had to endure adverse conditions to the point of exhaustion, resulting in a rapid increase in the number of inmates who were incapable of working."

The first commandant was SS-Hauptsturmführer Adolf Haas, replaced in December 1944 by SS-Hauptsturmführer Josef Kramer. With the advance of the Allies, the SS successfully destroyed many documents on its personnel in Bergen-Belsen. Consequently, over two hundred officers of the SS were never prosecuted during the postwar trials."

They were replaced by Soviet prisoners in 1941, most of whom did not survive the winter. By April 1943, Bergen-Belsen was increasingly resembling a concentration camp. The number of barracks increased as Jewish, Sinti, Roma, and other groups of inmates were transported to the camp. As the Allies advanced, thousands were evacuated from the other concentration camps to Bergen-Belsen. In April 1945, the prisoners exceeded 60,000. Heavily overcrowded barracks originally intended for 10,000 became a scene of disease outbreaks and mortality. Upon liberation, the British burned the barracks to prevent the spread of typhus."

Irma Grese and Josef Kramer are two especially notorious examples of these crimes against humanity."

Food was scarcest in the camp for prisoners. There were sharp increases in prisoner numbers in 1944, which led to a decrease in food rations across the camp. In 1945, when the death marches reached Bergen-Belsen, starvation had become widespread. There were also occurrences of cannibalism. Survivors recalled inmates begging for water in agony."

Every day, prisoners waited in long lines for a portion of food, which became increasingly scarce as the war progressed. Dirty food and water contributed to the growing unsanitary conditions at Bergen-Belsen, which led to the outbreak of typhus in 1944-1945."
